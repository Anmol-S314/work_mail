# YouGotMail - A Simple Email Client App
A Flutter Project
## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.



## Flutter Installation and Configuration

To set up Flutter, please consult the following guide for installing the necessary tech stack: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

After installing Flutter, Android Studio and command-line tools for the Android SDK are also required:

- Install and configure Android Studio by following this link: [Android Studio Installation](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)

- Download and configure command-line tools with these steps:

    - Launch Android Studio
    - Access "More Actions" on the boot window, select SDK Manager.
    - In the "Android SDK" section, navigate to SDK Tools.
    - Enable "Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)" and click OK.

Running `flutter doctor` may prompt you to accept some Android licenses. Use the following command to resolve this:


`flutter doctor --android-licenses`

## Launching the Application

This can be done in two ways:

- Set up an Android emulator using [these instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds).
- Run the application on your local Android device. This requires activating USB debugging in the developer options. Follow [this link](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device) for instructions.

This concludes the setup for Flutter.
